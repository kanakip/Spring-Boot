Common Spring Security Interview Questions and Answers
Basic Level Questions
1. What is Spring Security?
• A powerful authentication and authorization framework
• Provides security features for Spring-based applications
• Protects against common vulnerabilities like CSRF, session fixation
2. What are the main features of Spring Security?
• Authentication and Authorization
• Password encoding
• Session management
• CSRF protection
• Security headers
• OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect support
3. Difference between Authentication and Authorization?
Authentication	Authorization
Verifies who the user is	Determines what the user can do
Happens first	Happens after authentication
Involves credentials	Involves permissions/roles

    configuration.setAllowedMethods(Arrays.asList("GET", "POST"));
    UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
    source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", configuration);
    return source;
}
9. Explain JWT implementation in Spring Security

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .oauth2Login()
            .authorizationEndpoint()
            .baseUri("/oauth2/authorize-client");
    }
}
11. Explain Custom Authentication Provider

javaCopy to clipboard
@Component
public class CustomAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider {
    @Override
    public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) {
        // Custom authentication logic
    }

javaCopy to clipboard
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') or hasRole('MANAGER')")
public void deleteUser(Long userId) {
    // Method implementation
}
15. How to handle security in testing?

javaCopy to clipboard
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles = "ADMIN")
