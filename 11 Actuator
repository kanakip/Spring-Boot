Spring Boot Actuator is a powerful feature in the Spring Boot framework that provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application. Here's an overview of Spring Boot Actuator:
1. Purpose:
	• Monitoring: Provides health checks, metrics, and other operational information about your application.
	• Management: Allows you to manage your application through HTTP endpoints or JMX.
2. Key Features:
	• Health checks
	• Metrics
	• Auditing
	• HTTP tracing
	• Environment information
	• Loggers configuration
3. Endpoints: Spring Boot Actuator exposes several built-in endpoints, including:
	• /health: Shows application health information
	• /info: Displays arbitrary application info
	• /metrics: Shows metrics information for the current application
	• /env: Exposes properties from Spring's Configurable Environment
	• /loggers: Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application
4. Security:
	• Actuator endpoints are sensitive by default and should be secured in production environments.
	• You can configure security settings for individual endpoints or globally.
5. Configuration:
	• Enable Actuator by adding the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency to your project.
	• Customize endpoint exposure, security, and other settings in your application.properties or application.yml file.
6. Custom Endpoints:
	• You can create custom endpoints to expose application-specific information or operations.
7. Integration:
	• Actuator integrates well with various monitoring and management tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Spring Boot Admin.

To get started with Spring Boot Actuator:
8. Add the dependency to your pom.xml (for Maven):

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

1. Configure endpoints in application.properties:
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics

2. Access endpoints, e.g., http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
Spring Boot Actuator is an essential tool for monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications in production environments, providing valuable insights into your application's health and performance.

Certainly! Here's an example of how to set up and use Spring Boot Actuator in a simple Spring Boot application:
1. Create a new Spring Boot project (you can use Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE).
2. Add the Spring Boot Actuator dependency to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

3. Create a simple REST controller:

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot Actuator!";
    }
}

4. Configure Actuator endpoints in application.properties:

propertiesCopy to clipboard
# Expose all actuator endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
# Custom application info
info.app.name=Spring Boot Actuator Example
info.app.description=A simple example of Spring Boot Actuator
info.app.version=1.0.0

5. Run your Spring Boot application.

6. Access Actuator endpoints:
• Health check: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health Response: {"status":"UP"}
• Application info: http://localhost:8080/actuator/info Response:
{
  "app": {
    "name": "Spring Boot Actuator Example",
    "description": "A simple example of Spring Boot Actuator",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
• Metrics: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics This will show available metric names. To view specific metrics, append the metric name to the URL, e.g., http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests
• Environment: http://localhost:8080/actuator/env This shows the current environment properties.
