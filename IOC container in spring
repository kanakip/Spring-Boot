The IoC (Inversion of Control) container is a core component of the Spring Framework. It's responsible for managing the lifecycle of Java objects, known as beans, and their dependencies. Here's a brief overview of the IoC container in Spring:
 
1. Purpose:
	• Manages object creation
	• Configures objects
	• Manages object lifecycle
	• Wires dependencies between objects
2. Key features:
	• Dependency Injection (DI)
	• Bean lifecycle management
	• Bean scoping
	• AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) support
3. Types of IoC containers in Spring:
	• BeanFactory: Basic container, lazy-loads beans
	• ApplicationContext: Advanced container, extends BeanFactory with more enterprise features
4. Configuration methods:
	• XML-based configuration
	• Annotation-based configuration
	• Java-based configuration
5. Benefits:
	• Loose coupling between components
	• Easier unit testing
	• Modular design
	• Centralized configuration management
 
Example of using IoC container:
 
// Define a bean
@Component
public class MyService {
    // Service implementation
}
// Use the bean
@Autowired
private MyService myService;
 
In this example, the IoC container manages the creation and injection of the MyService bean, demonstrating inversion of control where the framework manages object lifecycles instead of the developer.
 
The IoC container is fundamental to Spring's architecture, enabling developers to focus on business logic while the framework handles object management and wiring
