1. MVC Architecture:
	• Model: Java objects representing application data and business logic.
	• View: Responsible for rendering the model data, typically using technologies like JSP, Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker.
	• Controller: Java classes handling user requests, processing input, and preparing the model for the view.
2. DispatcherServlet:
	• Core component of Spring MVC, acting as the front controller.
	• Receives all incoming requests and delegates them to appropriate handlers.
	• Configured in web.xml or through Java configuration.
3. Controllers:
	• Annotated with @Controller or @RestController.
	• Define handler methods to process specific requests.
	• Use @RequestMapping and its variants to map URLs to methods.
4. Request Mapping:
	• @RequestMapping: Maps URLs to controller methods.
	• Supports ant-style path patterns and HTTP method specifications.
	• Variants: @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping.
5. Model and ModelAndView:
	• Model: Interface to add attributes for the view to render.
	• ModelAndView: Combines model and view in a single return value.
	• Allows passing data from controllers to views.
6. View Resolution:
	• ViewResolver interface determines which view to use based on logical view names.
	• Common implementations: InternalResourceViewResolver, ThymeleafViewResolver.
	• Configurable prefix and suffix for view names.
7. Data Binding:
	• Automatically maps request parameters to model objects.
	• Uses PropertyEditor and Converter interfaces for type conversion.
	• @ModelAttribute binds form data to model objects.
8. Validation:
	• Supports JSR-303 Bean Validation annotations.
	• Custom validators can be implemented using the Validator interface.
	• @Valid annotation triggers validation of method parameters.
9. Exception Handling:
	• @ExceptionHandler for method-level exception handling.
	• @ControllerAdvice for global exception handling across multiple controllers.
	• Customizable error views and status codes.
10. Interceptors:
	• Implement HandlerInterceptor interface or extend HandlerInterceptorAdapter.
	• preHandle(), postHandle(), and afterCompletion() methods for request processing.
	• Useful for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security checks.
11. REST Support:
	• @RestController combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
	• Automatic conversion of return values to JSON/XML using message converters.
	• @RequestBody for deserializing incoming JSON/XML to objects.
12. File Upload and Download:
	• MultipartResolver for handling multipart requests.
	• CommonsMultipartResolver for Apache Commons FileUpload.
	• @RequestParam for accessing uploaded files in controller methods.
13. Internationalization (i18n):
	• LocaleResolver determines the current locale.
	• ResourceBundleMessageSource for managing localized messages.
	• MessageSource for retrieving localized messages in code and views.
14. Spring Security Integration:
	• Seamless integration with Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
	• Method-level security using annotations like @Secured, @PreAuthorize.
	• CSRF protection, session management, and more.
15. Testing:
	• MockMvc for testing controllers without starting a full HTTP server.
	• @WebMvcTest for focused controller tests with auto-configuration.
	• TestRestTemplate for full integration testing of REST controllers.
16. Configuration:
	• Java-based: @Configuration classes with @EnableWebMvc.
	• XML-based: mvc:annotation-driven in XML configuration.
	• Spring Boot: Auto-configuration with minimal setup required.
 
These topics cover the core functionality of Spring MVC, providing a robust framework for building web applications with clear separation of concerns and extensive features for handling web requests and responses.
