HTTP status codes are divided into five classes, and within these, there are numerous specific codes. Here's an overview:

1. 1xx (Informational) - Indicates a provisional response:
	• Examples: 100 (Continue), 101 (Switching Protocols), 102 (Processing).
2. 2xx (Success) - The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted:
	• Examples: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 202 (Accepted), 204 (No Content).
3. 3xx (Redirection) - Further action is required to complete the request:
	• Examples: 301 (Moved Permanently), 302 (Found), 304 (Not Modified).
4. 4xx (Client Error) - Indicates that the client made an error:
	• Examples: 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found).
5. 5xx (Server Error) - The server failed to fulfill a valid request:
	• Examples: 500 (Internal Server Error), 502 (Bad Gateway), 503 (Service Unavailable), 504 (Gateway Timeout).

Each category contains several codes, and new ones can be defined as needed. Would you like to explore a particular category in more detail? Let me know!


-----------------------

1xx Informational
These codes indicate that the request was received and the process is continuing:
	• 100 Continue: The server has received the request headers, and the client can proceed to send the body.
	• 101 Switching Protocols: The server agrees to switch protocols as requested by the client.
	• 102 Processing: Used in WebDAV, it means the server is processing the request, but no response is available yet.
2xx Success
These codes confirm that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed:
	• 200 OK: The request succeeded; the result depends on the HTTP method (e.g., GET retrieves data, POST updates data).
	• 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
	• 202 Accepted: The request was received but not yet acted upon.
	• 204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request but returned no content.
3xx Redirection
These codes indicate that the client needs to take additional action to complete the request:
	• 301 Moved Permanently: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
	• 302 Found: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
	• 304 Not Modified: The resource hasn’t changed since the last request; the client can use its cached version.
	• 307 Temporary Redirect: The resource is temporarily located at another URL, and the request method should not change.
4xx Client Errors
These codes mean there was a problem with the request sent by the client:
	• 400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to a client-side error (e.g., malformed syntax).
	• 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required, and the provided credentials are invalid or missing.
	• 403 Forbidden: The client is not allowed to access the requested resource.
	• 404 Not Found: The requested resource doesn’t exist on the server.
	• 405 Method Not Allowed: The HTTP method is not supported for the requested resource.
5xx Server Errors
These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request:
	• 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from completing the request.
	• 502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
	• 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to being overloaded or maintenance.
	• 504 Gateway Timeout: The server didn’t receive a timely response from an upstream server.


------------------

A protocol is essentially a set of rules or guidelines that define how devices, systems, or entities communicate and interact with one another. It's like a common language that ensures smooth and consistent communication. Protocols are widely used in various fields, especially in technology and networking.

 In Different Contexts:
1. Networking: 
   - Protocols define how data is sent, received, and processed across networks.
   - Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for websites, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfer, and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for internet communication.
